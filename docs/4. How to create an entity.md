# How to create an entity

Make sure database connection is configured properly in `.env`.

1. Run bin/console command

By providing the entity name as `User`, it creates both `User.php` and `UserRepository.php`. We can add the field through the command prompt.

```bash
app/bin/console make:entity
```
